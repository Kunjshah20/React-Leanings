1. Virtual DOM is not really used anymore.

2. React fibre : key features include the ability to pause, abort, or reuse work as new updates come in; the ability to assign priority to different types of updates; and new concurrency primitives.

3. Reconciliation
The algorithm React uses to diff one tree (browser DOM tree) with another (created using createRoot in jsx) to determine which parts need to be changed.

4. Reconciliation is the algorithm behind what is popularly understood as the "virtual DOM."

5. Although Fiber is a ground-up rewrite of the reconciler, the high-level algorithm described in the React docs will be largely the same. The key points are:

  a. Different component types are assumed to generate substantially different trees. React will not attempt to diff them, but rather replace the old tree   completely.
  b. Diffing of lists is performed using keys. Keys should be "stable, predictable, and unique." (example given below, from interview perspective this point   is important)
   - Suppose there is an array.
   - the array should be iterated and voh array ko lana hai in lists, buttons, paragraph, etc.
   - If keys are not being used , the react will give the warning and assigned the values
   - But why should we use keys ? => Because if we want to increase performance lists (as written in Fiber algorithm) then we should have unique keys

6. What is fiber ? 
   - pause work and come back to it later.
   - assign priority to different types of work.
   - reuse previously completed work.
   - abort work if it's no longer needed.
